## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts healthcare outcomes such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer risk. The focus is on ensuring: - Explainability: Understanding why the model makes specific predictions. - Fairness: Avoiding bias across demographic groups. - Effectiveness: Achieving high accuracy and actionable insights.

This model aims to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions while promoting ethical and equitable AI usage.

## Objectives

We wanted to use machine learning to predict the likely hood that a patient has heart disease. To do this
we needed to be able to take in new patent data through a front-end webapp interface, then use that data to test against the model data to predict the with chances that the users currently has or will have heart disease

## Data-sources

The original data source was hosted on [Kraggle](https://www.kraggle.com), however due to the limitations of that specific dataset

### Data Sets

We will utilize healthcare datasets suitable for classification tasks, including:

### Setup

Build project environment using conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**To remove the env, after installing a new tool and adding it to the yml**

```bash
conda remove --name project_2_env --all
```

### Tech Stack

[Environment](environment.yml)
