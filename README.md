# Project_2: Healthcare Outcome Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts healthcare outcomes such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer risk. The focus is on ensuring: - Explainability: Understanding why the model makes specific predictions. - Fairness: Avoiding bias across demographic groups. - Effectiveness: Achieving high accuracy and actionable insights.

This model aims to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions while promoting ethical and equitable AI usage.

### Data Sets

We will utilize healthcare datasets suitable for classification tasks, including:

### Setup

Build project environment using conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**To remove the env, after installing a new tool and adding it to the yml**

```bash
conda remove --name project_2_env --all
```
